Complete analysis to recognize digits (consist of different datasets) with neural nets(cnn), svm, random forest, and their combination to other classifiers (containing full parameter tuning, model architecture designing and full document for each of the phases). The main part is phase 4, that almost all important methods and tricks (regularization techniques, different layer types and network architecture, new loss function) are implemented.
