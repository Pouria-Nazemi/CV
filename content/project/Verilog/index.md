Developed a Gray-to-BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) converter using Verilog hardware description language and simulated it in Proteus SPICE software. This project demonstrates expertise in digital logic design and hardware description languages, showcasing proficiency in converting gray-coded inputs to their corresponding BCD representations. The implementation leverages Verilog's strengths in modeling digital circuits, highlighting skills in number system conversions and digital signal processing techniques.
