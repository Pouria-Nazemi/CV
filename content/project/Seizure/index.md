Developed a machine learning model for real-time seizure detection using physiological signals captured by an E4 wristband. The project focuses on building a model to predict seizures in patients based on four biosignals (BVP, ACC, EDA, TEMPerature) collected by the wearable device. This innovative approach combines signal processing, and machine learning to create a potentially life-saving medical device for continuous monitoring and early intervention in epilepsy cases.
