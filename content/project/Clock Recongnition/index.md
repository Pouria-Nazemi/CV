This program has a dataset which contains 15 photos of every numeral , and by processing them (Crop all of them and resize them into a same dimension) provides one average picture of each numeral and adjust its colors. Then every numeral of the input digital clock photo (which is in black and white) will be cropped and resize and compare with average photos which was produced from the dataset ,and recognize that figure. After recognition an analog clock will start to work from that time.

Besides above function this program can resize every photos and also it can crop multiple photos which are in table form and have white(RGB: 255, 255, 255) background.
