Developed a digital clock recognition system capable of reading analog clocks from images. The project demonstrates expertise in image processing, machine learning, and computer vision techniques. It begins by processing a dataset of numerals, cropping and resizing individual digits to a standard size. These preprocessed templates are then compared to corresponding digits in input black-and-white clock images, facilitating accurate digit recognition. Upon successful recognition, the system triggers an analog clock display from the recognized time. Additionally, the program offers functionalities for general-purpose image resizing and batch cropping of table-form images with white backgrounds, showcasing versatility in image manipulation tasks.
