Developed an interactive teaching assistant for a Fundamental of AI course, focusing on first-order logic concepts. This project demonstrates expertise in educational technology design and artificial intelligence applications in pedagogy. Students follow a storyline-based learning approach, completing exercises and answering questions related to first-order logic principles. The system culminates in a Prolog version of the Wumpus game, providing hands-on experience with logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.
