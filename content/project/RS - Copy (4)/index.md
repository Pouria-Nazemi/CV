This project implements a search and recommendation system for blockchain documents using Elasticsearch and Kibana. It leverages Flask as the web framework, integrating Elasticsearch for storing and querying the dataset of IEEE papers, and Kibana for visualization. The system allows users to input search terms and retrieves relevant documents, while also providing a recommendation feature based on content similarity. It employs natural language processing techniques for text preprocessing and utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for generating recommendations. The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building a specialized search and recommendation system for technical documents, showcasing integration of modern web technologies and data science techniques.
