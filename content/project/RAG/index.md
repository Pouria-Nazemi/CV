Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system over Falcon-7B, integrating pre-trained language models for efficient and intelligent text generation. This project leverages the powerful Falcon-7B transformer model to enhance question-answering tasks by retrieving relevant documents before generating responses. It includes integration with a retrieval mechanism, optimizing the modelâ€™s ability to access large knowledge bases, improving the relevance and accuracy of answers. The solution is designed for deployment on high-performance infrastructure, facilitating robust natural language understanding and generation.
