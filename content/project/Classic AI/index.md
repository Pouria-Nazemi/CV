Developed a solution for the popular 2048 puzzle game using advanced graph traversal and optimization algorithms. The project implements Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Iterative Deepening Search (IDS), and Uniform Cost Search (UCS) to find optimal moves in the game, demonstrating expertise in artificial intelligence, combinatorial optimization, and heuristic search techniques.
