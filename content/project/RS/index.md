Developed a search and recommendation system for blockchain-related documents using Elasticsearch and Kibana, integrated with a Flask-based web interface. This project showcases expertise in full-text search, data visualization, and natural language processing techniques applied to a specialized domain. The system leverages Elasticsearch for indexing and querying a dataset of IEEE papers, while Kibana provides interactive dashboards for data exploration. Users can input search queries and receive relevant document matches, supplemented by a recommendation feature based on content similarity. The implementation employs TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for generating recommendations, demonstrating proficiency in information retrieval and machine learning algorithms. This project highlights the integration of modern web technologies with data science techniques to create an efficient and user-friendly platform for accessing and exploring blockchain-related literature.
