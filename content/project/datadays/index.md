Participated in the "Data Days" anomaly detection challenge, implementing various advanced techniques for identifying unusual patterns in time series data. This project demonstrates expertise in anomaly detection methodologies, showcasing the application of multiple algorithms to identify and characterize anomalies in temporal data. The goal was to develop and compare different anomaly detection approaches, including statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning techniques, to identify unusual patterns in the dataset representing days of the year. The project culminated in testing these methods on unseen data not provided during the competition phase, highlighting skills in model evaluation and cross-validation strategies.
