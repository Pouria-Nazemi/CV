Developed a comprehensive operating systems simulation project focusing on parallel elevator movement control, incorporating graphical user interface (GUI) elements and addressing critical performance metrics such as starvation and utilization. This project demonstrates expertise in concurrent programming, resource allocation algorithms, and real-time system design. I implemented a multi-threaded solution for managing three elevators simultaneously, considering factors like passenger arrival rates, destination floors, and elevator service times.
