Developed a scalable, multiplayer quiz game application using synchronous socket programming and multithreading in Python. This project demonstrates expertise in concurrent programming, real-time communication, and large-scale data management. The game uses sockets for establishing connections between servers and clients, employing synchronous I/O operations to manage multiple client connections efficiently. Multithreading is utilized to handle simultaneous player interactions, ensuring responsiveness and scalability. The system presents multiple-choice questions to participants, who compete against each other in real-time, with final rankings determined by cumulative scores.
