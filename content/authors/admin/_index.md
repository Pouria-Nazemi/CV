#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm a recent graduate in Computer Engineering from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad with a strong academic and hands-on background in artificial intelligence and machine learning. My work bridges applied research and real-world development, with experience building intelligent systems across domains such as healthcare, network monitoring, and document analysis.
I’ve contributed to research projects like seizure detection using wearable biosignals at Neurosina and Persian document classification through OCR and language models. In industry, I’ve worked at Part Software Group as a Site Reliability Engineer, helping develop intelligent monitoring tools and leading efforts in anomaly detection. I’ve also applied machine learning to business analytics and sales forecasting at Pelekan Company.
Alongside technical work, I’ve been actively involved in teaching and mentorship — serving as a teaching assistant in AI and Linear Algebra, and mentoring students through the Cangrow AI program.
I'm currently exploring new opportunities where I can apply my experience to impactful, innovative AI projects — and continue learning and growing in a collaborative environment.
