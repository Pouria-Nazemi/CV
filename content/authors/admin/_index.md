#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am an accomplished BSc student in Computer Engineering at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, where I have excelled in my studies and research. My academic journey is complemented by hands-on experience in artificial intelligence and data science.

During my tenure at Part Software Group, I have been deeply involved in applying advanced AI techniques, particularly in anomaly detection. My role as an SRE Engineer involves leveraging cutting-edge technologies to ensure system robustness and address complex challenges through AI-driven solutions.

In addition to my industry experience, I have conducted significant research projects, including developing models for seizure detection using biosignals and working on the classification of old Persian documents. These projects underscore my ability to tackle diverse problems with innovative solutions.

I also have a passion for education and mentoring, which I have pursued through teaching roles and workshops. As a lecturer and teaching assistant, I have guided students in artificial intelligence, compiler design, and other technical subjects, helping to shape the next generation of technology experts.
