#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
I’m a BSc student at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, currently ranked 3rd in my class, with a strong focus on AI, ML, and Software Engineering. My research includes working on seizure detection using biosignals from the Empatica E4 at Neurosina and classifying Persian documents through OCR, which combines my interests in technology and language.

In addition to my academic work, I’m an SRE Engineer at Part Software Group, where I ensure infrastructure reliability, and a Data Scientist at Pelekan Company, applying ML for sales prediction and invoice analysis. I’m also passionate about teaching, having served as a TA in courses like AI and Compiler Design, and mentoring high school students through the Cangrow AI program. I’m excited to continue my education and explore new opportunities.
